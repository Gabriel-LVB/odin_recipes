    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Honey’s parents are American ex-pats living abroad in Tokyo, Japan, and while visiting them over the last seven or eight years, he’s collected dozens of favorite eateries throughout the city.</p>
    <p>There’s the best izakaya in Kichijoji, serving up casual Japanese pub food, and countless kiten-zushi restaurants, where my English-speaking Honey can choose small plates of freshly-made sushi from a moving conveyor belt without having to order in Japanese.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season
        </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
